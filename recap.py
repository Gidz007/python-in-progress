# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It can have different types of functions:
# Instance Methods (functions that use self)
# Class Methods (functions that use cls)
# Static Methods (functions that donâ€™t use self or cls)
# A static function inside a class is just a function that belongs to the class but does not depend on an instance. 
# An instance is an object created form a class, which is the blue print of an object.
